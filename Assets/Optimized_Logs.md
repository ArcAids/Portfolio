## Cursed Keenanâ€™s Name out loud 
ChangeList : `N/A`

Date: N/A Weather: N/A.

Comment: 
    Rant time:

Tried working on stack with Hot n cold for a day
Had some issue so reverted back.
Realized my particles render upside down and reverted back a lot to find that problem was in Object pooling. wasn't reseting values after getting from pool.
Phew, took so much time.

## Did matrix multiplication by hand.
ChangeList : `95216`

Date: Tuesday after MidNight, 1:40 PM , March 17, 2021. Weather: Omnious.

Comment: Did not help much since my draw is bottle necked by GPU.
```c
//Lost times.
```
---
## Improved on multiplication more!
also removed extra code from Draw along with all the temp Matrices

ChangeList : `95472`

Date: Wednesday Evening, 7:49 PM , March 17, 2021. Weather: Raining.

Comment: was hoping some serious improvements from matrix multiplication. but bottleneck is OpenGL
```c
// Lost times..

ChangeList : `95472`

Date: Wednesday Evening, 8:25 PM , March 17, 2021. Weather: Raining.

Comment: The times are with above 2 changes as well. Slight improvement in draw.
A lot of improvement in Update because of removing matrices and some useless calculations.

## Did Compiler optimization.
ChangeList : `95562`

Date: Wednesday Evening, 10:20 PM , March 17, 2021. Weather: walk worthy.

Comment: also made drawBuffer iterate by pointer instead of [i] but doesn't seem to make much difference since I'm still using for loop anyways.
