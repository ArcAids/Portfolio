            I am Arpit Sharma(AKA Arc). I am a recent Graduate adventurer from DePaul University with Game Programming Role. However, It all started a long time ago in far lands of India where I pursued BS in Software Engineering even before realizing I can use this new power and knowledge to make the very games I grew up playing!

<br>
<br>
            My Game dev journey began with Unity and in almost 2 years I was already a master in the Unity realm with a <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modular-bars-179746" target="_blank">UI bar tool</a> on Unity Asset Store and a couple of games on Play store and <a href="https://arcaid.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a> but that wasn't enough to quench my thirst for knowledge!
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            I decided to travel across seas to learn the arts of Game Programming from the Great Sages at DePaul where I've been leveling up my C++ skills along with some Unreal magic at DePaul's Original Game Studio for quite some while now.
            
<br>
<br>
            which brought me here, all prepared and ready for a real adventure with some battle hardened Elites!
